Fanny's Phone

In this funny world, Fanny is a funny girl always dreaming to buy her dream company’s phone that is manufactured by “Mapple” company. Problem is, as the phone is very expensive, she couldn’t afford buying it from her pocket money and instead waiting for a patient in need of a kidney, so that she can donate her kidney and buy her dream company’s phone. She has started the search of patient from year 2000.
There’s also a clause with “Mapple” company that every year it releases a new variant and every 3 years, a new model, i.e
2000 – LPHONE 1
2001 – LPHONE 1S
2002 – LPHONE 1S MAX
2003 – LPHONE 2
2004 – LPHONE 2S
2005 – LPHONE 2S MAX
2006 – LPHONE 3
.
.
.
.
. 
and so on.

Also each phone model has a unique key id associated. The key is generated by the company as the last 2 digits of the year variant was launched , multiplied by the respective no. of series i.e 
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21……, plus 8.
You are Fanny’s friend and have to help her in telling which phone (with variant Id) she would be getting of her dream company as there’s an astrologer friend of yours who can predict in which year patient would come to Fanny .Take input from astrologer and tell the phone variant to Fanny.
