Hellooo, Charles here is sending cards to his ‘n’ friends. For this, he has a sheet of paper of size w×h, which can be cut into pieces.
Charles can cut any sheet of paper w×h that he has in only two cases:
1.	If w is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size w2×h;
2.	If h is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size w×h2;
If w and h are even at the same time, then Charles can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.
After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by 1.
Help Charles to find out if he can cut his sheet of size w×h at into n or more pieces, using only the rules described above.

Input
The first line contains the number of test cases‘t’.
Each test case consists of one line containing three integers w, h, n the width and height of the sheet Charles has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to.

Output
For each test case, output on a separate line:
"YES", if it is possible to cut a sheet of size w×h into at least n pieces; "NO" otherwise.

Example
-> Input
3
