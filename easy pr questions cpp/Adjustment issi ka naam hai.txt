Camila goes for shopping ever month to a nearby store to buy some groceries. The list of items she needs every month are (listed in priorities ) :
1. Milk 60rs per day
2. Salt 42rs per month
3. Butter 56rs per month
4. Vegetables 200rs per day
5. Pulses 150rs per day
6. Fruits 550rs per month
7. Eggs 300 per month
8. Biscuits 250rs per month
9. Curd 20rs per day
10. Cornflakes 200rs per month 

Now the only problem is that her grocery budget changes every month and is based on her income. In the first month of every year she starts with 10,000rs . And then every month her salary is increased by 1000rs. Now she decides to buy only the things that she can afford. 
 
In the next upcoming months based on her salary she might be able to buy some more items.

For eg. In January, her total bill will be of 60*31 + 42 + 56 + 200*31 = 8158rs (till vegetables only)
From 10000 she is now left with 1842rs. This amount will be deposited into her bank account on the last day of the month itself.

After few months Camila will want to calculate her  savings.

Input: The month no. at the end of which Camila calculates her savings

Output: 
1.The grocery item name, according to the priority, uptill which she can afford to buy in that particular month.
2. Total savings at the end of that month

Sample input:
4 (ie. April)

Sample output:
Pulses
9914rs

Explanation of output : 
April salary =13000rs
April bill =12398rs
Account balance = 1842(jan) + 3622(feb) + 3842(mar) + 602(apr) = 9914rs

Note: not a leap year
