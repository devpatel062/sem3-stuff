//1. What is const? When should we use it?
//Variables declared with the const maintain constant values
const print = "hi";
console.log(print);
//const greeting = "say Hi";
    //const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared
//const object cannot be updated but it's properties can be updated.
